in this paper the author had created an algorithm SU-BRQR which outperforms both the MATCH and its improvements. throughout the paper the author has clearly explained how the algorithm works and its results have been displayed. the paper clearly makes us understand that the author has done a lot of research and it is clearly visible in the paper the way he explained the algorithm. the author also has compared the algorithm with both the MATCH and its improvement algorithms with results. this makes it a very good read and the one thing that is missing for the paper is that, the author never mentioned about the future workings or make an improvised version of SU-BRQR.
