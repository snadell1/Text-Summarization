In the paper "Online Lazy Updates for Portfolio Selection with Transaction Costs," the authors describe a system for optimizing a stock portfolio with the constraint that changing the portfolio incurs an additional cost proportional to the value of the stocks changed.

The paper presents an overview of the previous work on this topic, but does not seem to do a particularly good job of explaining the existing work, leaving the reader with a bit of confusion as to why this method demonstrates a measurable improvement over other methods. In addition, the paper heavily implies that the previous work on portfolio optimization uses future information that would not be available to a real trader, though this is clearly not true.

The major contribution of this work is a "Lazy Update" regularizer for ensuring that expected profits from the change of a section of a stock portfolio actually exceed the transaction costs for changing the section of the portfolio. This regularizer ensures that portfolio updates are done as sparsely as possible while still maximizing the final value of the portfolio.

The performance of the method is demonstrated in the results section, where the method is tested against the Buy-and-Hold method and the EG method proposed in a related piece of work. This comparison, however, does not seem to cover a large enough section of the related work to be an effective comparison. In addition, the comparisons are only done with methods that do not factor in transaction costs. This omission seems to indicate that the method was not actually compared with similar methods, so further comparisons with more methods would go further to convince that the method gives a significant improvement.
