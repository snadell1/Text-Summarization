In the paper "A Game-theoritc Machine Learning Approach for Revenue Maximization in Sponsored Search," the authors describe an auction system usable by search providers for their sponsored search mechanisms that allows the providers to maximize earned revenue. The authors describe their system in terms of the mathematical formulations necessary to implement the system.

The chief contribution of the system described within is the addition of a model of advertiser behavior to the iterated auction system. The rest of the system seems to follow either trivially or directly from previous work in the field by other researchers.

That said, as mentioned by the authors in the body of the paper, adding the Markov process that models advertiser behavior to the system does add substantial complexity to the system. To deal with this complexity, the authors propose a bi-level optimization system rather than a flat one-level optimization, allowing the model to maximize the results for advertisers and the auction operator. 

Overall, the authors present a novel approach to the problem of revenue maximization for sponsored search providers. However, I do have some problems with the presentation of the work. During the experimental evaluation, the authors state that "is it impractical to get the online responses of the advertisers and web users," saying that this challenge led them to a simulation approach. However, in the next paragraph, they state that "we use a log data of 300 days obtained from a commercial search engine." This contraction, though not fatal to the work, should be resolved before publication. In addition, during the presentation of results, the authors make claims concerning statistical significance, but do not back up those claims with a description of how a significance test was performed.
