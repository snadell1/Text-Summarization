The authors propose an adapted point-based approach to solving POMDPs.The goal is to utilize four, easily calculated, heuristics to determine if a plan repair is needed at a given belief state. The analogy given was a car driving along a road and then having a flat tire. In the normal belief space, such an event is unlikely, but if we find ourselves in such a state, it should be possible to repair our plan to handle it, without having to constantly explore this potential plan in the normal case.
	The authors tested four different heuristics which were intended to be useful and easily calculated for every action. These heuristics were gap betwee the upper and lower bounds of the current belief state, the distance between the current belief state and the next closest belief state, the difference between the best value at the current belief state and the average value of all belief states, and the current belief state entropy versus number of iterations. Once these heuristics pass a certain theta value, then a plan repair is triggered. By gating the plan repair procedure with these relatively easy to compute heuristics, the authors intended to reduce the load on the agent.
	In the result data, the algorithm seemed to be particularly effective in the reconnaissance domain, in both lower run time and higher total reward than the competing algorithms. The reward values were more than double standard SARSOP in all of the given domains.
