Author has presented an Online Reinforcement Learning algorithm over POMDP. Since the model needs to be learned the policy finding problems depends only on the action observation pairs. He has understood the problem associated with online policy determination and has brought down the time and space complexity of the problem as well. The soul idea behind the online algorithm is finding the next step using the immediate episodes only. This way the space complexity and calculation complexity is brought to O(1) and O(n) respectively in response to O(n) and O(n^2) in batch algorithm.

Accept - The novel idea is presented in the paper using EM algorithm and proper implementation on the problems has been provided.
Clarity of Presentation - The ideas are presented and the mathematical background is explained convicingly. There is just one problem in one of the equation as the solution to the equation hasnt been shown. Otherwise, the whole mathematical formulation is presented thoroughly.
Novelty - The previous work was on the Offline version of the Reinforcement learning on POMDP which was called the Batch Program. The new algorithm is for the online version and is hence closer to the real world problems. The thorough testing of the algorithm is properly shown.
