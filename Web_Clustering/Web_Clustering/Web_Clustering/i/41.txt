The paper persuasively sets up the problem it seeks to address - the intractability of Dec-POMDP solving on long time horizons. The solution the authors propose is thus potentially very important, and the results are compelling. Specifically, the authors describe a way of converting Dec-POMDPs to continuous state MDPs. The key necessary concept for this is "occupancy states." The technical explanation of this conversion seems technically sound and is a novel contribution, but the intuitive explanation of occupancy states and the core algorithm being introduced should have been clearer given that it is the crux of the paper. 

The feature-based heuristic search value iteration (FB-HSVI) algorithm exploits the structure of the value function to do lossless compression. This compression is critical as the occupancy state is substituting for what would otherwise be the extensive uncompressed history of the agents. The key insight introduced here, which I found quite important, is that the value function is piecewise linear and convex over occupancy states, which enables the aforementioned compression. Given this assumption, the results are unsurprising and are drawn from several domains, showing substantial speedups. Overall, the paper seems technically sound, novel, and important, though the reviewer has low confidence in his familiarity with Dec-POMDPs so can't recommend it strongly or nominate it for best paper.
